        <li><strong>Lentils: </strong>the base of this dal recipe is made with yellow moong dal or red split lentils — whichever you can find.</li>
        <li><strong>Produce: </strong>you’ll need onion, garlic and fresh ginger to give the dal lovely flavor. You’ll also be mixing in some fresh spinach later in the cooking process, plus some fresh lemon juice for a little brightness.</li>
        <li><strong>Spices: </strong>these super cozy spices are the star of the show. You’ll need ground turmeric, ground cumin, ground coriander, cayenne pepper, and plenty of salt and pepper.</li>
        <li><strong>For the broth: </strong>you’ll be simmering the lentils in a little tomato paste, diced or crushed tomatoes, coconut milk, and vegetable broth.</li>
        <li><strong>To garnish: </strong>top your bowl with fresh cilantro leaves!</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps:- </h2>
    <ol>
        <li><strong>Prep your lentils: </strong>Start by rinsing your lentils a few times until the water runs clear. Then cover them with fresh water and soak them for about 30 minutes to an hour.</li>
        <li><strong>Sauté the onions: </strong>Next you’ll want to sauté the onions in olive oil for a few minutes until they’re tender. Add in the ginger and garlic and cook until slightly browned.</li>
        <li><strong>Add spices: </strong>Stir in all of those cozy spices and cook everything for a few minutes until it darkens and smells aromatic.</li>
        <li><strong>Add tomatoes: </strong>Stir in the tomato paste and cook it for a couple of minutes, then pour in the crushed tomatoes and cook for a few minutes to reduce.</li>
        <li><strong>Pour in the broth: </strong>Next, add the coconut milk and vegetable broth and simmer everything for about 5 minutes.</li>
        <li><strong>Cook the lentils: </strong>Add your drained lentils to the pot and simmer for about 30 minutes until they’re soft and the curry is nice and thick. Stir in spinach until it wilts.</li>
        <li><strong>Thicken & serve: </strong>Add the fresh lemon juice and stir for about 10 minutes until the dal thickens to your liking. Then serve!</li>
