    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>The word ‘seekh’ means skewers and ‘kebab’ means meat cooked over a charcoal fire. So Seekh Kebab means skewered meat sausages cooked over a charcoal fire.
    Seekh Kebab are typically flavored with onions, garlic, ginger, green chili peppers, herbs, and spices. Pakistani Seekh kebabs are often made with ground beef, while Indian-style are usually made with ground lamb or ground chicken.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients:- </h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Whole coriander & cumin seeds</li>
        <li>Onion</li>
        <li>Green chili peppers such as Thai chili</li>
        <li>Cilantro & mint leaves</li>
        <li>Minced Meat</li>
        <li>Salt & pepper</li>
        <li>Garlic & ginger</li>
        <li>Red chili flakes </li>
        <li>Garam masala</li>
        <li>Papaya paste </li>
        <li>Neutral oil</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps:- </h2>
    <ol>
        <li><strong>Toast & grind the spices:</strong> Toasting deepens the flavor while removing the raw taste of the spices. This is especially important if you’re baking the kebabs.</li>
        <li><strong>Pulse to chop the onion, cilantro, mint, and green chili: </strong>Squeeze out the excess moisture and add to the ground beef.</li>
        <li><strong>Add the remaining ingredients: </strong>to the ground beef and mix to combine</li>
        <li><strong>Mix/knead the dough: </strong>vigorously until you can see the stringy texture of the meat. I like to use the paddle attachment of a stand mixer to do this.</li>
        <li><strong>Shape the kebab: </strong>See instructions and video on how to do this</li>
        <li><strong>Cook: </strong>Grill, pan-fry, air-fry, or bake.</li>
    </ol>
