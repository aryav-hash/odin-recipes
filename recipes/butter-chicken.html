    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Butter chicken is one of the most famous dishes associated with Indian restaurants, and if you have a craving, this is the recipe for you. Butter chicken uses tandoori chicken cooked in a tandoor (a type of Indian oven) that gives the chicken, subsequently, a wonderful smoky flavor. To replicate the smokiness, I roast the chicken in the oven and then broil it quickly. Serve this fragrant chicken dish with its decadent fiery red velvety sauce with kachumber salad, rice, or flatbread like naan.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 cup butter, divided</li>
        <li>1 onion, minced</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon minced garlic</li>
        <li>1 (15 ounce) can tomato sauce</li>
        <li>3 cups heavy cream</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons salt</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon cayenne pepper</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon garam masala</li>
        <li>1 Â½ pounds skinless, boneless chicken breast, cut into bite-sized chunks</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons vegetable oil</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons tandoori masala</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps:- </h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Gather all ingredients. Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).</li>
        <li>Melt 2 tablespoons butter in a skillet over medium heat. Stir in onion and garlic, and cook slowly until the onion caramelizes to a dark brown, about 15 minutes.</li>
        <li>Meanwhile, combine cream, tomato sauce, remaining butter, salt, cayenne pepper, and garam masala in a saucepan over medium-high heat; bring to a simmer.</li>
        <li>Reduce heat to medium-low, cover, and simmer, stirring occasionally, for 30 minutes. Stir in caramelized onions.</li>
        <li>While the sauce is simmering, toss chicken with vegetable oil until coated. Season with tandoori masala and spread out onto a baking sheet.</li>
        <li>Bake chicken in the preheated oven until no longer pink in the center, about 12 minutes.</li>
        <li>Add cooked chicken to the sauce and simmer for 5 minutes before serving.</li>
    </ol>
